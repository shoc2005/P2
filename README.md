# Building a Student Intervention System - supevised learning

The aim of this project - identify students who might need early intervention by using different supervised learning algorithms.


## Project environment (based on Python 2.7)
Necessary modules:
1) pandas (18.1 or greater)
2) numpy (1.11 or greater)
3) matplotlib (1.5.1 or greater)
4) iPython (4.2 or greater)
5) scikit-learn (0.18.0 or greater)
6) scipy (0.17.1 or greater)
7) jupyter notebook (1.0 or greater)

The best practice is to use [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) toolset with all pre-installed python modules and machine learning libraries.

## How to run
After the Python envirnonment setup is done. In command line type: jupyter notebook
This will launch a new browser window (or a new tab) showing the Notebook Dashboard, a sort of control panel that allows (among other things) to select which notebook to open.
